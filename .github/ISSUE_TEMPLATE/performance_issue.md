## ‚ö° Performance Issue

**Performance problem description**
A clear description of the performance issue you're experiencing.

**Expected performance**
What performance you expected based on documentation or benchmarks.

**Actual performance**
What performance you're actually seeing.

## üìä Measurements

**Benchmarking setup**
```rust
// Your benchmarking code
use memscope_rs::*;

fn main() {
    // Code that demonstrates the performance issue
}
```

**Performance metrics**
