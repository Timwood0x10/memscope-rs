# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the challenge of effectively integrating generated SVG visualizations (memory analysis charts, lifecycle timelines, and Unsafe/FFI dashboards) into HTML frontend applications. The current system generates high-quality SVG files but lacks a seamless way to embed and render them in web interfaces with proper interactivity and responsive design.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the memory tracking system, I want to view SVG visualizations directly in a web browser through an HTML interface, so that I can analyze memory patterns without needing separate SVG viewing tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates SVG files THEN it SHALL create an HTML report that embeds the SVG content directly
2. WHEN a user opens the HTML report THEN the SVG visualizations SHALL render correctly in modern web browsers
3. WHEN multiple SVG files are generated THEN they SHALL all be included in a single cohesive HTML interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user analyzing memory data, I want the SVG visualizations to be responsive and interactive in the web interface, so that I can effectively explore the data on different screen sizes and devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the HTML report is viewed on different screen sizes THEN the SVG content SHALL scale appropriately to fit the viewport
2. WHEN a user hovers over SVG elements THEN relevant tooltips or details SHALL be displayed where applicable
3. WHEN the SVG content is large THEN users SHALL be able to zoom and pan to explore different sections

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer integrating this system, I want multiple embedding options for SVG content, so that I can choose the most appropriate method based on my specific use case and technical requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating HTML reports THEN the system SHALL support direct SVG embedding as the primary method
2. WHEN direct embedding is not suitable THEN the system SHALL provide alternative embedding methods (iframe, object tags)
3. WHEN JavaScript is available THEN the system SHALL support dynamic SVG loading for enhanced performance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user viewing complex memory analysis reports, I want an organized interface with navigation between different visualization types, so that I can efficiently switch between memory analysis, lifecycle timelines, and FFI dashboards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple visualization types are available THEN the HTML interface SHALL provide tabbed navigation or similar organization
2. WHEN switching between visualizations THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and maintain user context
3. WHEN a specific visualization is selected THEN it SHALL be prominently displayed with appropriate sizing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator concerned with performance, I want the HTML report generation to be efficient and handle large datasets gracefully, so that the system remains responsive even with complex visualizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large SVG files THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading for non-visible content
2. WHEN generating HTML reports THEN the system SHALL optimize SVG content for web delivery
3. WHEN multiple large visualizations exist THEN the system SHALL provide options for selective loading or chunked rendering
