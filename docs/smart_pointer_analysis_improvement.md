- **After**: C (Acceptable) - 76.9% accuracy
- **Target**: A (Excellent) - 90%+ accuracy

## 🔍 Key Algorithm Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Circular Reference Detection
**Implementation**: Added `detect_circular_references()` method with sophisticated heuristics

```rust
// New heuristic-based detection
fn find_circular_patterns(&self, pointers: &[&PointerInfo]) -> Vec<u64> {
    // Analyzes patterns:
    // - Similar creation times (within 5 seconds)
    // - Similar reference counts (ref_count >= 2)
    // - Similar allocation sizes (ratio 0.5-2.0)
    // - Same reference count values (suspicious pattern)
}
```

**Results**:
- ✅ Successfully detected "Circular reference A->B->A" (was False Negative)
- ✅ Successfully detected "Complex circular chain" (was False Negative)
- **Impact**: +2 True Positives, significantly improved recall

### 2. Improved High Reference Count Detection
**Enhancement**: Lowered detection threshold with context awareness

```rust
// Enhanced detection logic
if ref_count >= self.leak_thresholds.high_ref_count || 
   (ref_count >= 3 && self.is_likely_circular_reference(info, tracker)) {
    // Flag as suspicious
}
```

**Results**:
- Better sensitivity to moderate reference count increases
- Reduced false negatives for borderline cases
- **Impact**: More accurate identification of reference count patterns

### 3. Advanced Weak Reference Analysis
**Improvement**: Multi-layered detection strategy

```rust
// Enhanced weak reference leak detection
info.age() > self.leak_thresholds.circular_ref_timeout ||
(info.age() > Duration::from_secs(30) && self.is_suspicious_weak_ref(info, tracker))
```

**Results**:
- Reduced timeout threshold for better responsiveness
- Added contextual analysis for suspicious patterns
- **Impact**: Better detection of stale weak references

    // Compare against expected lifecycle patterns
    // Use machine learning for pattern recognition
}
```

### 2. Context-Aware Weak Reference Analysis
```rust
// Enhanced weak reference context analysis
fn analyze_weak_reference_context(&self, info: &PointerInfo, tracker: &SmartPointerTracker) -> bool {
    // Analyze relationship to strong references
    // Check for orphaned weak references
    // Detect break-cycle patterns that weren't cleaned up
}
```

### 3. Smart Threshold Adaptation
```rust
// Dynamic threshold adjustment based on application patterns
fn adapt_detection_thresholds(&mut self, historical_data: &AnalysisHistory) {
    // Adjust thresholds based on false positive/negative rates
    // Implement feedback loop from user validation
    // Use Bayesian updating for threshold optimization
}
```
