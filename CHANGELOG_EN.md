## [0.1.5] - 2025-09-14

### Added
- **High-Performance Binary Export:** A new binary export format (`src/export/binary`) provides a faster and more compact alternative to JSON.
- **Unified Export API:** A new, tiered export API under the `export` module simplifies exporting data in different formats.
- **Advanced Tracking Macros:** Introduced `track_var_owned!` for ownership-based lifecycle tracking and `track_var_smart!` for automatic strategy selection.
- **Core Performance Primitives:** Added `ShardedRwLock`, `AdaptiveHashMap`, and other high-performance components in the `core` module to reduce lock contention and improve performance.
- **Benchmarking Suite:** A new suite of benchmarks (`benches/`) was added using the Criterion framework to measure and track performance.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Added extensive new user guides, API references, and examples in the `docs/` directory for both English and Chinese.
- **New Analysis Features:** Introduced new analysis capabilities, including an enhanced FFI function resolver and a memory passport tracker.
- **New HTML Dashboards:** Added new, more advanced HTML templates for visualizing analysis results.

### Changed
- **Core Architecture Refactoring:** The entire crate has been reorganized into a more modular structure (`core`, `analysis`, `export`, etc.). The core tracking logic was completely refactored for better performance and maintainability.
- **Default Tracking Behavior:** The `track_var!` macro now tracks variables by reference for zero-cost tracking by default.
- **Smart Pointer Handling:** Improved and centralized the tracking logic for `Rc`, `Arc`, and `Box` for more accuracy.
- **Dependencies:** Updated `Cargo.toml` to include `dashmap`, `criterion`, and `bincode` to support new features and performance improvements.

### Fixed
- **Concurrency Issues:** Replaced previous locking mechanisms with sharded locks and optimized mutexes to significantly reduce thread contention and improve stability in multi-threaded applications.
- **Inaccurate Lifecycle Tracking:** The new ownership-based tracking (`track_var_owned!`) and improved smart pointer logic provide more precise and reliable variable lifecycle analysis.
