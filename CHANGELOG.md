## [0.1.0] - 2025-07-09

### Added
- **Core Memory Tracking System**
  - Custom global allocator (`TrackingAllocator`) for automatic heap allocation tracking
  - Thread-safe memory tracker with deadlock prevention
  - Variable association using `track_var!` macro
  - Support for `Vec`, `String`, `Box`, `Rc`, and `Arc` types

- **Enhanced Visualizations**
  - Beautiful SVG memory usage charts with professional styling
  - Intelligent Rust type recognition and categorization
  - Human-readable memory sizes (KB, MB, GB format)
  - Color-coded type categories (Collections, Text, Smart Pointers, etc.)
  - Timeline visualization of allocation patterns

- **Export Capabilities**
  - JSON export for programmatic analysis
  - Enhanced SVG export with multiple chart types
  - Memory usage statistics and breakdowns
  - Type-based memory analysis

- **Safety & Performance**
  - Deadlock-free operation with `try_lock` strategies
  - Graceful error handling and recovery
  - Thread-local recursion prevention
  - Minimal performance overhead (< 5% typical)

- **Comprehensive Testing**
  - Unit tests for core functionality
  - Integration tests for real-world scenarios
  - Stress tests for high-load situations
  - Safety tests for memory safety validation
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Edge case testing

- **Documentation**
  - Complete API documentation
  - Usage examples and tutorials
  - Security analysis and risk assessment
  - Performance characteristics documentation

### Security
- Comprehensive security analysis covering memory safety, thread safety, and resource management
- Extensive testing for edge cases and error conditions
- Safe handling of unsafe allocator code with panic protection

### Performance
- Optimized lock usage with consistent ordering
- Non-blocking tracking operations where possible
- Memory overhead of ~50-100 bytes per tracked allocation
- Export operations complete in < 10 seconds for 10,000+ allocations

## [0.1.1] - 2025-07-10

### Added
- **Enhanced Lifecycle Timeline Visualization**
  - New `export_lifecycle_timeline()` method for generating timeline SVGs
  - Chronological visualization of memory allocation events
  - Variable scope and lifetime relationship analysis
  - Timeline-based memory usage patterns and hotspot detection

- **Improved SVG Visualizations**
  - Updated legend system with clearer color coding and categorization
  - Enhanced type recognition and simplified type name display
  - Professional gradient backgrounds and improved visual styling
  - Better layout and spacing for complex memory usage patterns

- **Standardized Naming Conventions**
  - Recommended naming format: `program_name_memory_analysis.svg` for memory analysis
  - Recommended naming format: `program_name_lifecycle_timeline.svg` for timeline visualization
  - Consistent file naming across all export functions
  - Clear separation between memory state analysis and temporal lifecycle tracking

### Changed
- **Code Cleanup and Optimization**
  - Removed redundant `src/export.rs` file (functionality merged into `export_enhanced.rs`)
  - Removed example `src/main.rs` file to reduce codebase complexity
  - Fixed all clippy warnings for better code quality
  - Improved error handling and type safety

- **Enhanced Documentation**
  - Added comprehensive lifecycle timeline analysis guide to README
  - Detailed interpretation guide for timeline visualizations
  - Updated examples with lifecycle timeline generation
  - Improved use case descriptions and optimization guidance

### Fixed
- All clippy warnings resolved (format string optimization, range checks, etc.)
- Improved type inference and error handling
- Better memory timestamp handling for timeline generation
- Enhanced thread safety and performance optimizations

## [Unreleased]

### Planned Features
- Configuration options for production use
- Memory usage limits and cleanup policies
- Additional export formats (HTML, CSV)
- Integration with profiling tools
- Real-time monitoring capabilities
