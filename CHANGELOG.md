## [0.1.0] - 2024-01-15

### Added
- **Core Memory Tracking System**
  - Custom global allocator (`TrackingAllocator`) for automatic heap allocation tracking
  - Thread-safe memory tracker with deadlock prevention
  - Variable association using `track_var!` macro
  - Support for `Vec`, `String`, `Box`, `Rc`, and `Arc` types

- **Enhanced Visualizations**
  - Beautiful SVG memory usage charts with professional styling
  - Intelligent Rust type recognition and categorization
  - Human-readable memory sizes (KB, MB, GB format)
  - Color-coded type categories (Collections, Text, Smart Pointers, etc.)
  - Timeline visualization of allocation patterns

- **Export Capabilities**
  - JSON export for programmatic analysis
  - Enhanced SVG export with multiple chart types
  - Memory usage statistics and breakdowns
  - Type-based memory analysis

- **Safety & Performance**
  - Deadlock-free operation with `try_lock` strategies
  - Graceful error handling and recovery
  - Thread-local recursion prevention
  - Minimal performance overhead (< 5% typical)

- **Comprehensive Testing**
  - Unit tests for core functionality
  - Integration tests for real-world scenarios
  - Stress tests for high-load situations
  - Safety tests for memory safety validation
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Edge case testing

- **Documentation**
  - Complete API documentation
  - Usage examples and tutorials
  - Security analysis and risk assessment
  - Performance characteristics documentation

### Security
- Comprehensive security analysis covering memory safety, thread safety, and resource management
- Extensive testing for edge cases and error conditions
- Safe handling of unsafe allocator code with panic protection

### Performance
- Optimized lock usage with consistent ordering
- Non-blocking tracking operations where possible
- Memory overhead of ~50-100 bytes per tracked allocation
- Export operations complete in < 10 seconds for 10,000+ allocations

## [Unreleased]

### Planned Features
- Configuration options for production use
- Memory usage limits and cleanup policies
- Additional export formats (HTML, CSV)
- Integration with profiling tools
- Real-time monitoring capabilities
