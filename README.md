## What is this thing?

memscope-rs is a Rust library for tracking memory allocations and generating analysis reports. Think of it as a friendly neighborhood memory detective üïµÔ∏è that helps you understand what your variables are up to when you're not looking.

It provides simple macros for variable tracking and exports data in JSON and SVG formats. Perfect for those "wait, where did all my memory go?" moments.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Multi-threading Support Status

**Current Status: Single-threaded environments work reliably. Multi-threaded scenarios require additional design and optimization.**

#### ‚úÖ What Works Well (Single-threaded)

- Variable tracking with `track_var!` macro
- Memory allocation and deallocation monitoring
- Smart pointer reference counting (Rc, Arc, Box)
- JSON/SVG/HTML export functionality
- Memory leak detection and analysis
- Interactive dashboard generation

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Multi-threading Limitations

The current implementation has known issues in multi-threaded environments:

**Root Cause:** The global `MemoryTracker` uses multiple `Mutex<T>` instances that can lead to deadlocks:

```rust
pub struct MemoryTracker {
    active_allocations: Mutex<HashMap<usize, AllocationInfo>>,
    bounded_stats: Mutex<BoundedMemoryStats>,
    history_manager: Mutex<AllocationHistoryManager>,
    ownership_history: Mutex<OwnershipHistoryRecorder>,
    stats: Mutex<MemoryStats>,
    // Multiple mutexes = potential deadlock risk
}
```

**Symptoms you might encounter:**

- Application hangs when using `track_var!` in multi-threaded code
- Deadlocks during memory tracking operations
- Inconsistent tracking results
- Performance degradation under high concurrency

#### üõ†Ô∏è Current Workarounds

If you need to use memscope-rs in multi-threaded applications, we provide several mitigation options:

**Option 1: Disable Global Tracking**

```bash
export MEMSCOPE_DISABLE_GLOBAL=1
# This completely bypasses global state, safe but limited functionality
```

**Option 2: Enable Fast Mode**

```bash
export MEMSCOPE_TEST_MODE=1
# Uses simplified tracking logic with reduced lock contention
```

**Option 3: Async-Compatible Mode**

```bash
export MEMSCOPE_ASYNC_MODE=1
# Skips heavy operations that can cause deadlocks
```

**Option 4: Limit Test Concurrency**

```bash
export RUST_TEST_THREADS=1
# Force single-threaded execution for testing
```

#### üîÆ Future Plans

We are actively working on a lock-free multi-threaded implementation that will include:

- Lock-free data structures using atomic operations
- Per-thread local buffers with periodic aggregation
- Sampling-based tracking similar to profiling tools like `perf`
- Better separation between fast-path operations and analysis

## Core Features

### 1. Variable Tracking

- **Non-intrusive tracking**: Use `track_var!` macro to track variables without breaking your existing code (we promise!)
- **Smart pointer support**: Full support for `Rc<T>`, `Arc<T>`, `Box<T>` - because Rust loves its smart pointers
- **Lifecycle analysis**: Automatic recording of variable lifecycles from birth to... well, drop
- **Reference count monitoring**: Real-time tracking of smart pointer reference count changes (watch those Rc clones!)

### 2. Memory Analysis

- **Memory leak detection**: Find those sneaky leaks hiding in your code
- **Fragmentation analysis**: Basic heap fragmentation reporting
- **Usage pattern detection**: Simple memory usage pattern recognition
- **Performance issue identification**: Spot memory-related bottlenecks

### 3. Data Export & Interactive Visualization

- **JSON export**: Export detailed memory allocation data for programmatic analysis
- **Binary export**: Efficient binary format for large datasets with faster I/O
- **SVG visualization**: Generate memory usage charts and timelines (pretty pictures!)
- **üéØ HTML Interactive Dashboard**: Full-featured web-based dashboard with clickable charts, filterable data, and real-time analysis
  - **Binary ‚Üí HTML**: Convert binary snapshots directly to interactive HTML dashboards
  - **JSON ‚Üí HTML**: Transform JSON analysis data into rich web visualizations
- **Multiple export modes**: Fast mode, detailed mode, and "let the computer decide" mode

### 4. Safety Analysis

- **FFI boundary tracking**: Monitor memory interactions between Rust and C/C++ code
- **Security violation detection**: Identify potential memory safety issues
- **Use-after-free detection**: Catch those "oops, I used it after freeing it" moments

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```rust
use memscope_rs::{init, track_var, get_global_tracker};

fn main() {
    // Initialize memory tracking (don't forget this, or nothing will work!)
    init();
  
    // Create and track variables
    let my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    track_var!(my_vec);
  
    let my_string = String::from("Hello, memscope!");
    track_var!(my_string);
  
    let my_box = Box::new(42); // The answer to everything
    track_var!(my_box);
  
    // Variables work normally (tracking is invisible, like a good spy)
    println!("Vector: {:?}", my_vec);
    println!("String: {}", my_string);
    println!("Box: {}", *my_box);
  
    // Export analysis results
    let tracker = get_global_tracker();
    if let Err(e) = tracker.export_to_json("my_analysis") {
        eprintln!("Export failed: {} (this shouldn't happen, but computers...)", e);
    }
}
```

### Smart Pointer Tracking

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::sync::Arc;

// Track reference counted pointers
let rc_data = Rc::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);
track_var!(rc_data);

// Track atomic reference counted pointers (for when you need thread safety)
let arc_data = Arc::new(String::from("shared data"));
track_var!(arc_data);

// Cloning operations are also tracked (watch the ref count go up!)
let rc_clone = Rc::clone(&rc_data);
track_var!(rc_clone);
```

### Export Configuration

```rust
use memscope_rs::ExportOptions;

let options = ExportOptions::new()
    .include_system_allocations(false)  // Fast mode (recommended)
    .verbose_logging(true)              // For when you want ALL the details
    .buffer_size(128 * 1024);           // 128KB buffer (because bigger is better, right?)

if let Err(e) = tracker.export_to_json_with_options("detailed_analysis", options) {
    eprintln!("Export failed: {}", e);
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

Based on actual testing (not marketing numbers):

### Tracking Overhead

- **Small programs**: ~5-15% runtime overhead (not too bad!)
- **Memory usage**: ~10-20% additional memory for tracking data
- **Large datasets**: Performance degrades significantly (we're working on it)

### Export Performance

- **Small datasets** (< 1000 allocations): < 100ms (blink and you'll miss it)
- **Medium datasets** (1000-10000 allocations): 100ms - 1s (time for a sip of coffee)
- **Large datasets** (> 10000 allocations): Several seconds (time for a full coffee break)

### Known Limitations

- **Thread safety**: Basic support, may have issues under heavy concurrency
- **Memory leaks**: Tracking itself may leak memory in some scenarios (ironic, we know)
- **Platform support**: Limited testing on different platforms
- **Error handling**: Some errors are silently ignored (we're working on being more vocal)

## Current Development Status

### English Assessment

#### What works reliably:

  - **Status**: Active work in progress to replace with safe alternatives
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Thread safety**: Basic support only, not thoroughly tested under concurrency
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Memory leaks in tracker itself**: Tracking system can leak memory (ironic but true)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Inconsistent API design**: Some modules use different patterns and conventions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited platform testing**: Mainly tested on specific development environments

#### Production readiness:

- üö´ **Not suitable for production**: Current status is experimental/development tool only
- üö´ **No stability guarantees**: APIs may change, memory safety not fully validated
- ‚úÖ **Good for development debugging**: Excellent for understanding memory patterns during development
- ‚úÖ **Educational value**: Great for learning Rust memory management concepts

### Planned improvements :

#### High Priority :

- üîÑ **Multi-threading safety**: Implement lock-free tracking architecture
- üîÑ **Replace dangerous `unwrap()` calls**: 154 calls need proper error handling
- üîÑ **Performance optimization**: Reduce overhead for large datasets
- üîÑ **Memory leak fixes**: Fix tracker's own memory leaks

- üîÑ **Real-time monitoring**: Live memory tracking dashboard

## Use Cases

### ‚úÖ Recommended Use Cases

#### Single-threaded Applications

#### **Development debugging** : Track memory usage during development

- **Performance optimization** : Identify memory bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- **Memory leak troubleshooting** : Locate and fix memory leak issues
- **Code review** : Analyze code memory usage patterns
- **Educational demos** : Demonstrate Rust memory management mechanisms
- **Algorithm analysis** : Understand memory behavior of data structures and algorithms

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Use with Caution

### Multi-threaded Applications

- **Only with workarounds** : Use environment variables to disable problematic features
- **Testing environments** : Single-threaded test execution with `RUST_TEST_THREADS=1`
- **Development debugging** : Limited tracking with `MEMSCOPE_DISABLE_GLOBAL=1`

**Required precautions for multi-threaded use:**

```bash
# Choose one of these approaches:
export MEMSCOPE_DISABLE_GLOBAL=1   # Safest: disables global tracking
export MEMSCOPE_ASYNC_MODE=1       # Skips heavy operations
export MEMSCOPE_TEST_MODE=1        # Uses simplified tracking
export RUST_TEST_THREADS=1         # Forces single-threaded execution
```

### üö´ Not Recommended

- **Production environments**: Not stable enough, use mature tools instead
- **High-performance applications :** Tracking overhead may be unacceptable
- **Critical systems** : Potential deadlocks and memory leaks in tracker itself
- **Large-scale applications** : Performance degrades significantly with large datasets
- **Concurrent servers** : Multi-threading limitations make it unsuitable

## Technical Architecture

The project uses a modular design:

- **core/**: Core tracking functionality and type definitions
- **analysis/**: Memory analysis algorithms and pattern recognition
- **export/**: Data export and visualization generation
- **cli/**: Command-line tools and user interface
- **bin/**: Executable analysis tools

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application hangs or deadlocks in multi-threaded code:**

```bash
# Use one of these environment variables:
export MEMSCOPE_DISABLE_GLOBAL=1   # Completely disable global tracking
export MEMSCOPE_TEST_MODE=1        # Use simplified tracking logic
export MEMSCOPE_ASYNC_MODE=1       # Skip heavy operations
export RUST_TEST_THREADS=1         # Force single-threaded execution
```

**Panic with "unwrap() called on None":**

```bash
# Enable safer fallback behavior
export MEMSCOPE_TEST_MODE=1
# Or disable specific features
export MEMSCOPE_DISABLE_BACKTRACE=1
```

**Export fails with large datasets:**

```rust
// Use smaller buffer or exclude system allocations
let options = ExportOptions::new()
    .include_system_allocations(false)
    .buffer_size(32 * 1024);
```

**High memory usage:**

```bash
# Disable backtrace collection
cargo run --no-default-features --features tracking-allocator
```

**Permission errors on output:**

```bash
# Ensure write permissions
mkdir -p MemoryAnalysis
chmod 755 MemoryAnalysis
```

**Performance degradation:**

```bash
# Use fast mode with reduced tracking
export MEMSCOPE_FAST_MODE=1
# Or disable expensive operations
export MEMSCOPE_DISABLE_ANALYSIS=1
```
