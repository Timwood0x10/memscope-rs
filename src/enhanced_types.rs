//! Enhanced types for comprehensive memory analysis
//!
//! This module contains additional type definitions needed for the enhanced memory analysis system.
//! These types support advanced memory tracking features including stack/heap distinction,
//! temporary object optimization, fragmentation monitoring, generic type analysis,
//! object lifecycle tracking, and memory access pattern analysis.
